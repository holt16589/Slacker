# Slacker

Slacker is a single page, slack-like chat application, where users can chat in public channels. The side navigation bar allows a user to either create a new channel or select an existing channel to join. Once a user joins a channel, the newly joined user is announced to everyone and users can chat in realtime without needing to reload the page. Each user has an avatar, which is generated using Adorable Avatars (http://avatars.adorable.io/) based on the user's username. The application also supports sending images and automatically converts URLs into links using AnchorMe (https://github.com/alexcorvi/anchorme.js).

This application was built using Python, Flask and Javascript using Web Sockets with a HTML/CSS frontend.
